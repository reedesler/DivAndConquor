We continued adding gameplay features to the game. The game can now be paused and started with a button inn the UI.
Pirate ships will now attack the player ships with cannons, and they player is able to shoot back. Pirate ships will
now also spawn randomly around the worls as the player explores. We also improved the stability of the game, reducing
lag in certain spots.

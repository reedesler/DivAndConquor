For this milestone we are running behind schedule because of starting from scratch after using SDL for our first
milestone and deciding that it wasn't sufficient enough for our needs.

We have reimplimented the features from the previous milestone, plus further gameplay features.

The player's ship can now interact with the world by uncovering unexplored territory. As the ship moves, everything it
can see is added to the map that the player sees. Everything that has been seen before but isn't visible now is dimmed.
Eventually the player will only see enemies within the bright parts of the map.

The ship moves around the map by pathfinding to it's destination tile. Everything not yet explored is treated as open
water, and as the ships uncover more of the map the paths they are taking update dynamically.

We added some basic UI buttons but haven't implimented their functionality yet, so they are hidden in the current
state of the game.

We have also updated the engine to support different types of game objects, such as the settlement that appears in the world.

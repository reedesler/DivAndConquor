We continued adding features to the game. More game objects are now implemented (sailors as ground units now
support pathfinding). Basic resource functionality is added (ground units are now able to collect resources).

Water is now rendered using multiple samples to avoid redundancy in rendered texture. Additionally, tile map
is now wrinkled to imitate natural formation of continents to some extent.

Resource class is implemented. Ground units are able to collect resources walking through them (collision
detection). Settlement accounts are updated to reflect collection of a particular resource.

Work on the UI is continued. The player is now able to build more ships for a settlement. Other aspects of UI
are also improved (smooth zooming based on cursor position).

Some text rendering functionality is added to further improve the UX.

Enemy pirate ships were added, that move towards the closest player ship by pathfinding. A timestepping physics system
was added to the ships and other units, allowing them to collide with each other. Now all ship and land unit movement
is through forces, with friction and collision added. When enemy ships collide, they do damage to each other and
are destroyed if they lose all their health.

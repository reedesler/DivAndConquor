We continued adding features to the game. More game objects are now implemented (sailors as ground units now
support pathfinding). Basic resource functionality is added (ground units are now able to collect resources).

Water is now rendered using multiple samples to avoid redundancy in rendered texture. Additionally, tile map
is now wrinkled to imitate natural formation of continents to some extent.

Resource class is implemented. Ground units are able to collect resources walking through them (collision
detection). Settlement accounts are updated to reflect collection of a particular resource.

Pirate ship object is added. Pirate ships are programmed to approach the closest player-controlled object
following a curved path. Attacks are still WIP.

Work on the UI is continued. The player is now able to build more ships for a settlement. Other aspects of UI
are also improved (smooth zooming based on cursor position).

Some text rendering functionality is added to further improve the UX.

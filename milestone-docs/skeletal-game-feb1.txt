For this submission we have implemented the following features:

Working application rendering code with rendering one sprite in a static,
relatively to the screen, position in addition to map tiles displaying
appropriate textures and a set of game objects consisting of multiple
pirate ships and the Player Boat.

We have 2D transformations for multiple game objects (pirates and Player Boat
move around the map) as well as the camera movement transform.

Keyboard control for camera moves and zooming is implemented. Player Boat can 
be controled with mouse clicks. Pirate ships are (intentionally) randomly 
travel through the gameworld.

Game objects including pirate ships and Player boat support smooth movement
from point A to B along a straigh line.

Stable code supports continuing execution and graceful termination.

At this point we have a complete world map with three kinds of textures rendered
on it including water, grass, and sand. We developed a python utility that allows
us to generate (pseudo)randomly seeded maps of various sizes and densities, and save
them as a 2D array of integers to a text file for loading in the game.

We are moving forward in accordance with out proposed plan. We did not implement
all the features required for allowing the users to create settlements because
during the planning we did not have clear understanding of how many features are
required for such functionality. We continue implementing the classes required for
game objects, and consider different UI solutions.

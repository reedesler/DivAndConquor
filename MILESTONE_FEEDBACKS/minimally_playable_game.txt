* Core part:
  - No decision based behaviour (-10)
  - No Instructions is included  (-5).
  - Gameplay is very basic (-5)
  - Game executes and terminates smoothly
  - Sprites match the input behaviour
* Creative Part (12.5/25):
  - Fog of war (+5)
  - Refactoring the terrain rendering (+5)
  - Path finding (but from external library, so does not count towards grade) 
  - Minor new sprites. (+2.5)

Grade: 80/100

The game has made substantial progress from the previous milestone, but the game type that they are aiming for requires many element to be in place as well as a tested AI to pose a challenge to the player. The members have all made contributions, but I think there were aspects of the game more worth improving than the creative features they decided to focus on. Right now the game needs a start and an end, the interactions between the player ship and the enemies as well as the exploration/strategy mechanics are in place but work is required to design good pirate/land-units behavior to have robust termination conditions. I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to speak with one of the members, but the code commits and contribution are in line with that of the other team members. 

## Milestone Requirements (55):
+0/15 Geometry: no polygonal asset
+15/20 Collisions: The grid tiling is used to speed up collision detections, but it still uses bounding boxes
+15/15 Physics: Force-based ship movement
+15/15 Non-linear motion: Pirate ships follow a curved trajectory to attack the player
+10/10 Stable game code

## Milestone creative (25):
+10 Working ui with text rendering
+10 Randomized tile corner placement
+5 More unit types in the ground which interact with water units

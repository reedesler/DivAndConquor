Grade: 80/100

The game has made substantial progress from the previous milestone, but the game type that they are aiming for requires many element to be in place as well as a tested AI to pose a challenge to the player. The members have all made contributions, but I think there were aspects of the game more worth improving than the creative features they decided to focus on. Right now the game needs a start and an end, the interactions between the player ship and the enemies as well as the exploration/strategy mechanics are in place but work is required to design good pirate/land-units behavior to have robust termination conditions. I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to speak with one of the members, but the code commits and contribution are in line with that of the other team members.
